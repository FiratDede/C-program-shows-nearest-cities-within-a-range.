# C-program-shows-nearest-cities-within-a-range.
This C program shows the nearest cities within in range  according to a specific geographic position. This geographic position consists of latitude and longitude. The  cities will be sorted from the nearest city to the most distant city within the calculation range and will be written to an output file including data about the cities. This program is executed from the command line as below using 5 command line arguments: </br>
>.\program.exe <AircraftLongitude(Deg)> <AircraftLatitude(Deg)> <SearchRange(km)> WorldCities.txt <OutputFileName> <</br>

For example when  you write  something to your command line like that: </br>
.\hw1.exe 32.0 39.0 130 WorldCities.txt Out1.txt </br>
This command creates an Out1.txt file which shows the cities are far from the geographic position( 32.0 lattitude 39.0 longitude ) at most 130 km.
